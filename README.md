# FrontEndMentorChallenges

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Frontend Mentor challenges that I have completed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here, you will find a collection of responsive web development projects that demonstrate my skills in building modern and user-friendly web interfaces.

### About Frontend Mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) is a platform that provides real-world frontend challenges to help web developers improve their skills. These challenges cover a wide range of web development topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.

### Project Highlights

In this repository, you will find:

- **Challenge Descriptions**: Each challenge is organized into its own directory, and within each directory, you will find a `README.md` file with a detailed description of the project requirements and design specifications provided by Frontend Mentor.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files**: The code for each challenge is structured into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if applicable). These files contain my solutions to the challenges, demonstrating my proficiency in these technologies.

- **Responsive Design**: I have focused on creating responsive designs for each project to ensure they look and function well on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
